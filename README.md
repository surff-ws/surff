# Web servers in pure Rust :crab:

With this repository, you can learn how to implement a singlethreaded and a multithreaded web server with Rust.

## Cargo
Build the library with ```cargo build```

Run the server:
```cargo run -p multithread```

And go to http://127.0.0.1:7879/ in your browser.

Or explore:

```cargo run -p singlethread```

No library, explore the binary at [./singlethread/src/main.rs](./singlethread/src/main.rs).
